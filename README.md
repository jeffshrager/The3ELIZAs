# The3ELIZAs -- a Git Repo composed by Jeff Shrager
----->>>>> REPLACE FOR FINAL COMMIT: April 1, 2022 @ 09:16PDT <<<<<-----

This repo contains the 3 "root" ELIZA programs, from which almost all other ELIZAs were cloned:  

  ~1965: Joseph Weizenbaum's original ELIZA in MAD-SLIP
      (re-discovered by Jeff Shrager in 2021 in JW's archives at MIT) 
  ~1966: Bernie Cosell's BBN LISP ELIZA, created based on JW's 1966 CACM paper
      (transcribed from a printout provided by BC, and made to work in Common Lisp by a team headed by Jeff Shrager)
  ~1973: Jeff Shrager's BASIC ELIZA
      (as it appeared in 1977 as published in Creative Computing in an article by Steve North)

Most other ELIZAs were either based on the LISP or BASIC versions, or are based on the algorithm in JW's 1966 CACM paper. 

  Weizenbaum, J. (1966). ELIZA: A computer program for the study of natural language communication between man and machine. 
  Communications of the ACM, 9, 36-45.

Where possible, several versions of these programs are provided, in PDF and sometimes in ASCII text. The BASIC and LISP
versions will run in modern BASICs and LISPs (perhaps with a little updating), but the MAD-SLIP version cannot be run, as
there is, as far as I know, no working MAD-SLIP compiler or emulator.  

This is the only version of this repo created by and authorized by Jeff Shrager. 
This final commit, to update the readme timestamp will never be superseded.
